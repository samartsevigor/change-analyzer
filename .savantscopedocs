# .savantscopedocs â€” file and directory patterns and documentation links
#
# Syntax:
#   - Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are comments and ignored.
#   - Include patterns (no leading '!') specify files/directories or external URLs to include as documentation.
#   - Exclude patterns (leading '!') remove matching entries from the documentation scan.
#   - Glob patterns follow .gitignore-style ("**" for any directories).
#   - URLs (http:// or https://) are allowed and treated as documentation links.
#
# Default documentation patterns:
docs/**/*.md
docs/**/*.txt
docs/**/*.pdf
docs/**/*.html
contracts/**/*.sol
README.md
#
# Default exclusions (ignore vendor or generated docs):
!docs/vendor/**
!docs/generated/**
#
# Usage examples:
# 1) To add an external documentation link:
#    https://example.com/docs/overview.html
#
# 2) To include a specific PDF:
#    docs/specification.pdf
#
# 3) To exclude temporary docs:
#    !docs/tmp/**
#
# 4) To include only HTML files in a subfolder:
#    docs/api/**/*.html
#
# Place custom overrides below any defaults.
